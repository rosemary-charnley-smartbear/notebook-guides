    "- **Pact Broker**: Free and open-source, self-hosted service for sharing and verifying pacts.  \n",
    "- **API Hub for Contract Testing**: Fully managed, enterprise-grade SaaS platform that builds on the Pact Broker, adding advanced features, integrations, and security. API Hub for Contract Testing is offered SaaS and On Premise, under its legacy name PactFlow. Please speak to your sales representative if you believe On Premise is required.  \n",

    "### Use **API Hub for Contract Testing** if:\n",
    "- You want a **turnkey** managed service with minimal ops overhead.\n",
    "- You need **enterprise security**, SSO, compliance, and audit capabilities.\n",
    "- Your team needs **deep CI/CD integrations** and rich dashboards.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies that are serious about Contract Testing, that is scaling and managing at the Enterprise level, require a good broker solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both tools share the same **core functionality**: storing, sharing, and verifying contracts in a Pact ecosystem. Pactflow builds on the open-source Pact Broker with a **focus on enterprise readiness**, **automation**, and **developer productivity**—reducing operational burden and adding governance features that are critical in large-scale, regulated environments.\n",
