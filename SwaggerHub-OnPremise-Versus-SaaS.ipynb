    "# Comparison: SwaggerHub On-Premise vs SwaggerHub SaaS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "[SwaggerHub](https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/) is an API design and documentation platform from SmartBear, providing collaborative API definition, visualization, and lifecycle management tools.  \n",
    "It is available in two main deployment options:  \n",
    "- **On-Premise** – Installed and managed in your own infrastructure (datacenter or private cloud).  \n",
    "- **SaaS** – Fully hosted and managed by SmartBear in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | SwaggerHub On-Premise | SwaggerHub SaaS |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Hosting Location** | Your infrastructure (VM, Kubernetes, private cloud) | Hosted in SmartBear’s managed cloud environment |\n",
    "| **Cost Model** | License fee + infrastructure and operational costs | Subscription (includes hosting, scaling, and management) |\n",
    "| **Setup** | Installed and configured by your IT/DevOps team | Ready to use after account provisioning |\n",
    "| **Upgrades** | Manual, scheduled by your team | Automatic, managed by SmartBear |\n",
    "| **Maintenance** | You handle monitoring, scaling, backups | Fully managed by SmartBear |\n",
    "| **Security Control** | Full control over data storage, network, and security | SmartBear-managed environment with enterprise-grade security |\n",
    "| **Compliance** | Can be configured to meet internal or industry-specific compliance needs | Meets SmartBear’s compliance standards (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.) |\n",
    "| **Disaster Recovery** | Managed by your operations team | Included in SaaS offering |\n",
    "| **Performance & Scaling** | Depends on your infrastructure and configuration | Auto-scaled and high availability built-in |\n",
    "| **Access Control** | Supports SSO, role-based access control, LDAP/AD | Supports SSO, role-based access control |\n",
    "| **Integrations** | Same integrations as SaaS; requires internal setup | Preconfigured cloud integrations (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, etc.) |\n",
    "| **Network Isolation** | Can be deployed entirely offline / air-gapped | Public internet with optional VPN or IP allowlisting |\n",
    "| **SLAs & Support** | Enterprise support with custom escalation | Enterprise support + guaranteed uptime SLAs |\n",
    "| **Release Cadence** | You control update timing | Continuous, incremental updates by SmartBear |\n",
    "| **AI Capabilities** | Not available | Available (AI-assisted API design and documentation suggestions) |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Choose Which\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choose **SwaggerHub On-Premise** if:\n",
    "- You require **full control** over hosting, infrastructure, and data residency.\n",
    "- You operate in **air-gapped** or highly regulated environments.\n",
    "- You have strict **internal compliance** or data governance policies.\n",
    "- You have the DevOps resources to manage installation, scaling, and updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choose **SwaggerHub SaaS** if:\n",
    "- You want a **zero-maintenance**, turnkey API design solution.\n",
    "- You prefer **automatic updates** and new features without downtime.\n",
    "- You need **scalability** and **high availability** without managing servers.\n",
    "- You want to leverage **AI-powered API design assistance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Both **On-Premise** and **SaaS** SwaggerHub deployments offer the same **core API design, collaboration, and documentation features**.  \n",
    "The choice comes down to **control vs convenience**—On-Premise offers maximum control and isolation, while SaaS offers ease of use, rapid updates, and AI capabilities.\n"
